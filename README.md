The significance of this work lies in addressing the critical need for efficient energy management, contributing to global energy conservation goals. The research's impact extends by providing an innovative solution to the challenge of energy wastage and aligning with advancements in computer engineering. The outcomes aim to contribute valuable insights and advancements to the broader community interested in smart energy management systems.

Introduction 
The increasing emphasis on sustainable energy practices has spurred interest in intelligent energy management strategies. This project introduces "EcoSync - Smart Energy Management Control with Occupancy Awareness," a system designed to optimize energy usage through a combination of occupancy awareness and intelligent management. By integrating an advanced occupancy sensor with intelligent energy control, EcoSync aims to enhance energy efficiency while prioritizing user conveniency. 
The system is complemented by a user-friendly mobile application, providing an intuitive interface for monitoring and controlling energy consumption. This initiative draws insights from Varakantham, P., Gupta, H. O., & Ghosh, S. (2017), contributing to the discourse on smart grids and intelligent energy management strategies. In doing so, we aim to advance sustainable energy practices and technological innovation.



Design Project Objectives
The aim of this project is to establish and implement "EcoSync - Smart Energy Management Control with Occupancy Awareness," an intelligent system designed for managing energy consumption. The primary focus is on optimizing energy use in residential and commercial spaces by incorporating occupancy awareness and intelligent energy control. Through the creation of a user-friendly mobile application and the integration of room-specific occupancy detection, along with energy-saving features, the goal is to minimize unnecessary energy usage, promote sustainable practices, and align with the global initiative for energy conservation. The EcoSync system strives to enhance overall energy efficiency while ensuring user comfort and convenience.

Respondents
For this study, the participation of residents or occupants in both residential and commercial spaces where the EcoSync system is deployed is essential. The experiences and feedback from these participants will play a critical role in evaluating the effectiveness and usability of the EcoSync prototype. Employing a purposive sampling method, a sample size of 20 participants has been chosen based on the specific criteria relevant to the study. This approach ensures that the selected participants offer diverse perspectives, reflecting various occupancy patterns in different settings. The decision for a sample size of 20 is guided by the relevance of participants to the study rather than statistical considerations, emphasizing a balanced approach that allows for meaningful insights while considering the practical constraints of a student project. This adjusted sample size is designed to yield valuable feedback on the EcoSync prototype, striking a practical balance between research objectives and resource limitations.
